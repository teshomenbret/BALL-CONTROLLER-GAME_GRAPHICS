# Ball-Controller-Game
Ball Controller Game, In the game we are going to have a ball that is moving in a 3D world enviroment which is surrounded by different obstacles from all directions. The player must keep the ball safe from colliding with the obstacles by giving direction instructions like, to right, left or up. The game is over when the ball collides with one of the obstacles. When we say the obstacle we are referring to a 3D object(like a box) or an empty space(space that can`t hold the ball in place or cause the ball to fall). As common to all games we will build a score counting mechanism.
