# Ball-Controller-Game

Ball Controller Game, in this game the ball is moving in a 3D world surrounded by different obstacles from all directions. The player must keep the ball safe from colliding with the obstacle by moving the ball right, left and up. The game is over when the ball collides with the obstacle. When we say the obstacle we are referring to a 3D object(like a box) or an empty space(can`t hold the ball in place or cause the ball to fall) that moves towards the player. As any game we will build a score counting mechanism.
